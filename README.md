IT IS A ML BASED CHAT BOT THAT CAN BE TRAINED ON ANYKIND OF DATA SET ACCORDING TO THE NEED OF USER(TEXT FILE)
LIBRARY USED - CHATTERBOT

# INTRODUCTION 

The language independent design of ChatterBot allows it to be trained to speak any language. Additionally, the machine-learning nature of ChatterBot allows an agent instance to improve itâ€™s own knowledge of possible responses as it interacts with humans and other sources of informative data.

# HOW IT WORKS

ChatterBot is a Python library designed to make it easy to create software that can engage in conversation.

An untrained instance of ChatterBot starts off with no knowledge of how to communicate. Each time a user enters a statement, the library saves the text that they entered and the text that the statement was in response to. As ChatterBot receives more input the number of responses that it can reply and the accuracy of each response in relation to the input statement increase.

The program selects the closest matching response by searching for the closest matching known statement that matches the input, it then chooses a response from the selection of known responses to that statement.
